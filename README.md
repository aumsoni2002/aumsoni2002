# üí´ About Me:
üî≠ I am currently pursuing an Advanced Diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis at Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology in Toronto. The program has given me a strong foundation in various aspects of computer science, including software development, web development, object-oriented programming, database management, and more. I have also gained knowledge in areas such as Linux systems, internet fundamentals, digital fundamentals, mobile application development, networking, data security, and software development life cycle (SDLC).<br>     As I progress through the program, I am developing a deeper understanding of these concepts and strengthening my skills through hands-on projects and assignments. I am excited to apply my knowledge and expertise to real-world scenarios and contribute to the development of innovative software solutions. As a junior software developer, I am eager to collaborate with experienced professionals and expand my skill set even further.<br><br>ü§ù As a Computer Programming Student, I am actively seeking opportunities to join a team as a Junior Software/Web Developer and collaborate on projects related to software and web development. With a strong background in Javascript and its frameworks, including React and Angular, as well as experience working with Spring 3 and Spring Boot 6, I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to projects that drive innovation and create cutting-edge technology.<br>      Having completed my studies for an Advanced Diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis from Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology in December 2023, and with nearly one year of experience as a Web Developer Co-op, I am ready to take on new challenges and continue growing in my career as a developer. I am passionate about software development and am excited to work alongside like-minded individuals who share my passion for creating meaningful and impactful technology.<br><br>üå± As a student, I am dedicated to continuously improving my skills and knowledge in various areas of software development. Currently, I am focused on expanding my knowledge in full-stack development with React as the front-end framework and Spring framework as the back-end framework. I am also learning data structures and algorithms using Java to enhance my problem-solving abilities. Additionally, I am exploring UI/UX design using WordPress and Figma, which will help me to create visually appealing and user-friendly applications.<br><br>üí¨ Feel free to ask me about my experience in software development and web development, my technical skills, or my approach to problem-solving. I am always eager to share my knowledge and learn from others.<br><br>‚ö° Fun fact: Despite the stress of job hunting, I've managed to keep my sense of humor intact! In fact, I've applied to so many companies that I'm starting to think I could write a book called "100 Ways to Get Rejected for a Job." Maybe I should stick to playing cricket and watching Netflix for a while...
